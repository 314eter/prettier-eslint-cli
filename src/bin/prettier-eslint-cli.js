// yargs stuff goes here
// you can look at this as an example: https://github.com/kentcdodds/split-guide/blob/master/src/bin/index.js
// basically configure yargs and pass along the options to `../index.js`
// though `../index.js` may not be necessary... Kinda depends. But I like to avoid logic in here!
